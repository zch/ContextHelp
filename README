ContextHelp
===========
ContextHelp is a component for Vaadin (http://vaadin.com) providing context sensitive help.

ContextHelp shows a bubble containing your specified help text when the user presses a special
key (F1 by default). The bubble opens right next to your field, with a small arrow pointing at
the field.

ContextHelp also supports opening the help bubble programmatically and following focus.
